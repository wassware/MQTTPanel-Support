# MQTT Panel-Support
I make extensive use of the IOT MQTT Panel on Android.

I have managed to do everything I need with it and when you are familiar with it it is very quick to set up. There is a pic of the panel with projects that use it.

I have 2 main connections: one to local network and one to my cloud Hive mqtt broker. The MqttBridge connects the local and Hive worlds. These is a pic of the main connection panel.

However its not easy to share the setup of an individual panel. It is possible to export the whole setup as a Json backup file and load it to another device. So the best I can do is to expose a copy of the backup (without connection details). One option is to load it to a spare device and remove all the panels you don't need, or make notes of a panel to add it to an existing setup.
